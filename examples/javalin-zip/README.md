# Javalin 6 Zip example

## Introduction
A basic pet store application written with the [Javalin 6](https://javalin.io) framework. You can build and test it locally as a typical Javalin 6 application.

This example application is functionally identical to the springboot-zip, except it is using the Javalin framework.  The Spring Boot Zip [template.yaml](../springboot-zip/template.yaml) can be used with this application as well.  

## Architecture
*At the time of writing this example,* using `sam local start-api` with the x86 architecture and LambdaAdapterLayerX86 would not work properly on a Mac with Apple Silicon (M1/M2).

For that reason, this example uses the Arm64 architecture and LambdaAdapterLayerArm64.  This configuruation worked flawlessly on a 2022 MBP with Apple silicon.

Using the above mentioned springboot-zip example's template.yaml file works perfectly for everything, except `sam local start-api`.  Using that template.yaml file has the additional benefit of [SnapStart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/snapstart.html) support.  SnapStart is not available for Arm64 at the time this example was written.

Please note that using `sam local start-api` is not required for local development.  A developer could simply run the application directly through their preferred IDE/debugger or any other java (version 17+) runtime.

## Getting Started

The application can be deployed in an AWS account using the [Serverless Application Model](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model). The `template.yaml` file in the root folder contains the application definition.

To run the application we are using the run.sh script located in the resources folder:

```shell
#!/bin/sh

exec java -cp "./:lib/*" "com.amazonaws.demo.petstore.Application"
```

In the configuration we have to specify the AWS Lambda adapter as a layer and configure the script as handler:

```yaml
 Properties:
      MemorySize: 512
      Handler: run.sh
      CodeUri: app/
      Runtime: java17
      Architectures:
        - arm64
      AutoPublishAlias: live
      Environment:
        Variables:
          RUST_LOG: info
          READINESS_CHECK_PATH: /healthz
          REMOVE_BASE_PATH: /v1
          AWS_LAMBDA_EXEC_WRAPPER: /opt/bootstrap
      Layers:
        - !Sub arn:aws:lambda:${AWS::Region}:753240598075:layer:LambdaAdapterLayerArm64:23
```

### Remove the base path

The pet store application is deployed under /v1/{proxy+}. But the application does not know that. So in the SAM template file, we configured environment variable `REMOVE_BASE_PATH=/v1`. 
This configuration tells the Adapter to remove `/v1` from http request path, so that the pet store application works without changing code. 


## Pre-requisites

The following tools should be installed and configured.

* [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
* [SAM CLI](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sam-cli)
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

## Deploy to Lambda
Navigate to the sample's folder and use the SAM CLI to build the application:

```shell
$ sam build
```

This command compiles the application and prepares a deployment package in the `.aws-sam` sub-directory.

To deploy the application in your AWS account, you can use the SAM CLI's guided deployment process and follow the instructions on the screen

```shell
$ sam deploy --guided
```

Once the deployment is completed, the SAM CLI will print out the stack's outputs, including the new application URL. You can use `curl` or a web browser to make a call to the URL

```shell
...
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OutputKey-Description                        OutputValue
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PetStoreApi - URL for application            https://xxxxxxxxxx.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/v1/pets
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
...

$ curl https://xxxxxxxxxx.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/v1/pets
```

## Clean up

This example use provisioned concurrency to reduce cold start time. It incurs additional cost. You can remove the whole example with the following command. 

```shell
sam delete
```
